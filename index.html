  <p>North Cestrian are proud to represent in Trafford football competitions at every year group. Throughout a students time here, there is an opportunity to represent the school from Year 7 right through until Year 11. 
      We adopt a consistent approach across our boys and girls teams and both have the opportunity to play in the same number of fixtures.
      For those who choose not to play competitively, there are extra-curricular clubs that promote mass participation. These are often delivered by teaching staff as well as expert coaches.</p>

    <p class="list-group-item col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >I have to say from the day we switched apps to arbor, it has made a nesscary and vital change to our school.
      Arbor is a good app for schools and is used by the majority of schools in Great Britain. There are two accounts available for the Arbor app, you have a student account used by the student
      and a parent account ued by the guardia of the student.You may be wondering why we changed apps? That is because Arbor encourages students more on doing there homeowork, and i have to say it is really useful for the
      teachers here. Arbor is realy useful for organinzing your sudents school day. Perhaps they have a detetion or a school trp, Arbor is the perfect place to tell you when such a event occurs. If anyone is having any 
      technical issues or questions please email the email underneath.</p>

      canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past.Online Menus with photographs of the 
      meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingrediants help boh students and parents make the right nutritional choices. 
      Each student or staf member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a school canteen account on their school website that keeps
      track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements that they have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online
      can eliminate all the fuss od money handline, a=king it less complicate for everyone. Here again diversity is key.</p>
